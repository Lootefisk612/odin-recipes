             <h3>How to Make Glazed Carrots</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>BOIL. Add 1/2 inch water to an oven-safe skillet over medium heat. Boil carrots for 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
                    <li>COAT. Drain the water and then add in the butter and sugar. Stir until coated. Sprinkle with salt and pepper.</li>
                    <li>ROAST. Place carrots in the oven and roast 10-15 minutes, or until fork tender and the sugar has caramelized. Alternatively, you can keep cooking them in the pan until tender.</li>
